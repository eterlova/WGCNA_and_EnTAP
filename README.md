# WGCNA and EnTAP
A tutorial &amp; literate programming guide to using WGCNA with expression data and annotations from EnTAP.

Large parts of this tutorial are adapted directly from [Steve Horvath's WGCNA tutorial](https://horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/). The primary aim of this repository and tutorial is to aid those with *de novo* transcriptomes who have annotated those transcriptomes using [EnTAP](https://entap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The secondary aim of this repository is to serve as supplemental information for a forthcoming publication. 

* Part 1: Load expression data and trait data
* Part 2: Pick soft-thresholding power and detect modules
* Part 3: Examine module/trait correlation
* Part 4: Incorporate annotations 
* Part 5: Create visualization of TOM (optional)
